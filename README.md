The goal of this project (code name: Monster Master) is to create a set of tools to aid game developers in authoring new creatures for their settings.

Ideally, these tools would take a set of existing creatures as input. Then, they would learn from this input and produce a model for classifying creatures within a system according to some notion of game balance.

### Pathfinder RPG

Currently, a simple proof-of-concept for this approach exists for creatures from the Pathfinder RPG.
