This folder contains the source and resource files for a Maven eclipse project. The code defines a web app that classifies a Pathfinder creature by CR.

#### Notes
* If you want to re-create the eclipse project, it is important to add weka.jar to the project's build path.
* Before running the web app, make sure the /public folder is in the $HOME/Desktop/monster-master/ folder.
